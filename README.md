<h1>Loan Approval Prediction</h1>

This repository contains a project for predicting loan approval using a machine learning model. The project focuses on determining whether a loan should be approved or not based on various factors such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and more.

<h3>Project Overview</h3>

In this project, we use logistic regression to classify loan applications as either approved or not approved. The dataset consists of features like income, loan amount, and credit history, which are used to train the model.

<h4>Dataset</h4>

The dataset used in this project contains information on:

<li>no_of_dependents</li>	
<li>education</li>	
<li>self_employed</li>	
<li>income_annum</li>	
<li>loan_amount</li>	
<li>loan_term</li>	
<li>cibil_score</li>	
<li>Assets</li>
<br>

The dataset is split into training and testing sets, where the model is trained using the training set and evaluated on the test set.

<h3>Model</h3>

<h4>Logistic Regression</h4>

Logistic regression is used as the primary machine learning algorithm in this project. It’s a simple yet effective classification algorithm, particularly suited for binary classification problems like this one.
